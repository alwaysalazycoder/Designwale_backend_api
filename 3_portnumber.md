## port number

The port number is “tacked on” to the end of the IP address, for example, “192.168. 1.67:80” shows both the IP address and port number. When data arrives at a device, the network software looks at the port number and sends it to the right program.
Different port numbers are used to determine what protocol incoming traffic should be directed to. Port number identifies a specific process to which an Internet or other network message is to be forwarded when it arrives at a server. Ports are identified for each protocol and It is considered as a communication endpoint.
